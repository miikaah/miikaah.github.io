      <p class="intro">
        I'm an experienced developer with 7 years of know-how in modern web
        technologies. The thing I like most about this work is I get to solve
        concrete problems through software design. I like working as part of an
        agile team doing full stack web development. I also like learning new
        things and technologies. I'm most proficient working with Node.js and
        React but have used many different frameworks and libraries. I've been a
        part of creating many new systems and have maintained many existing ones
        so I've gathered a lot of knowledge on how to create efficient backends
        and frontends.

              This was a short project for a company in the retail sector that
              specializes in cooling solutions. The task was to update their
              ipads for one biggest retail trade shows in Europe, Euroshop 2023.
              I worked with another consultant from Wunderdog.
            </p>
            <p>
              I updated the codebase to the new designs, added new features and
              30+ new products to the existing system. I also wrote some utility
              scripts that used ffmpeg to speed up image manipulations. Together
              we then implemented a screensaver feature for multiple different
              product showcase videos.

              I learned a lot about Vue and was positively impressed by the

              This assignment was in a company that provides a multi-platform
              advertising solution with a strong focus on social media
              platforms. I worked full stack with 7 other developers and a PO.

              I held a central role in a major rebuilding of the core service
              that automates ad, ad set and campaign management for Snapchat.
              The project was done in close partnership with Snapchat with a
              very ambitious deadline.
            </p>
            <p>
              By combining a tightly focused mindset with strong team-building
              dynamics, we were able to meet all the given deadlines and
              targets. I am personally humbled by the praise I got in my central
              role in the success of the project.

            <h4>Backend developer</h4>
            <p>
              This assignment was in a food delivery company specializing in
              real-time logistics optimization. I worked as a backend developer
              for the Drive project (new business vertical) in a team of 5
              people (4 developers and a PM).
            </p>
            <p>
              My role was to design and create a new backend system that
              connected the new Drive UI into the Drive microservice API and
              existing company services. The point of this was to enable
              customers to test (and even use) Drive without having to do
              possibly expensive integration work themselves before seeing how
              it actually worked.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this role I saw how splitting up an existing monolith to
              microservices can have major improvements to scalability and
              stability. I learned how to use hapi.js and io-ts, learned more
              about MongoDB and studied how the Protocol Buffers encoding works
              extensively as I found it interesting. I also handled the
              authentication and authorization of JSON Web Tokens for this
              backend as I have done many times before in other projects.

            <h4>Fullstack developer</h4>
            <p>
              This assignment was in a media company that creates content in
              both digital and print formats & has a wide ranging portfolio of
              digital services. I worked full stack adding new features to a
              self service portal for the Single-Sign-On authentication platform
              (500 000+ MAU) used by the company's digital services in a team of
              7 people.
            </p>
            <p>
              I took sole ownership of the backend that handled the self-service
              functions and sending of email to the users. I made numerous
              improvements to the codebase both in terms of maintainability and
              architecture. I was appreciated for my role in fixing /
              maintaining the CI, making debugging the service a lot easier and
              for dramatically increasing the test code coverage from almost
              nothing to over 90 %. I also learned how to use DynamoDB.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the front end side I vastly improved how the various small web
              pages like password recovery were created. I modularized the
              codebase and created a Multi-Page App generator with Handlebars,
              Webpack and S3 which got rid of thousands of lines of copy-paste.
              On top of this I designed and added new features to the React
              frontend of the self-service portal and wrote e2e tests for it
              that were run on many different devices in Browserstack Automate.

              I implemented the frontend features for listing and deleting Job

            <p>
              This was a short and sweet project that taught me that sometimes

              international operators and other companies. I worked full stack

              My first task was to write the backend side of an integration to
              Microsoft SQL Server database used to store Power BI reports. As
              this task was quite straightforward and was completed relatively
              quickly I then moved on to other tasks in the project. I handled
              various tickets related to showing reports in the web portal and
              created new views for a new reporting view that was moved from a
              legacy system to this portal.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned quite a bit about microservices in this project both
              advantages and disadvantages.

              This assignment was in a health technology company that focuses on
              preventative health metrics. I worked as a front end developer for
              rebranding their marketing website with another consultant from
              Wunderdog, a designer, a PO and a PM.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was a pretty short stint but we rewrote most of the existing
              codebase as the new designs were vastly superior to the old ones
              and most of the time the existing code didn't fit well with them.
              We were both commended for our can-do attitude as another team the
              PO and PM worked with was having lots of difficulties while by
              comparison we were going at light speed. To be honest we had a lot
              easier task at hand but it was still motivating to hear positive
              feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned that even though a schedule can be tight you can get a
              lot more done than you think by just staying motivated and
              sticking to the plan.

              They had previously ordered a 2 month project that produced this

              had no time to waste so I worked as quickly as I could and was

              This assignment was in a digital law office that offers a set of
              tools to protect people and workplaces from social media
              catastrophes and online harassment. I worked full stack with
              another consultant from Wunderdog and the company CTO. I also
              helped on-board a new developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              My role was to further develop the microservices that had already
              been designed. I worked a lot on the login flow which was a little
              different than usual as the service was to be used anonymously to
              protect the users' privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned many new technologies in this project like Next.js,
              Typeform, i18n for React, how to create a Progressive Web App and
              Datadog APM. I also solved a critical lag problem on older mobile
              devices by reverse-engineering enough of Typeform so we could drop
              their laggy sdk on the frontend. This was important as the company
              wanted the app to look great and work smoothly at Slush.

            <h4>Fullstack developer</h4>
            <p>
              This project was for a service that helps companies grow in the
              Keski-Karjala area. I worked full stack on creating a new web
              portal for buying and renting business spaces and plots with
              another consultant from Wunderdog.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote the backend side of the service, created user
              authentication with AWS Cognito and eventually moved to the front
              end to complete rest of the work. On that side the component I
              contributed to the most was the file upload that had image
              cropping. I also coded the admin functionalities and search
              filtering.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned a lot of how React works, especially React hooks and
              learned to code styled-components in this project. When the
              project was finished I took care of the handover to Wunderdog
              sister company OrangIT.

            <h4>Fullstack developer</h4>
            <p>
              Grano is the biggest printing house in Finland. There was a need
              after many mergers to create a new webshop for B2C and B2B
              customers that would unify the multiple bespoke systems. I took
              part in the designing of what became a general purpose e-commerce
              webshop platform and worked full stack on it in a team of 5
              developers and PO.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the two years I worked on most parts of the system. Too
              many to enumerate or to remember. The things that stand out were
              User authentication and authorization with AWS Cognito and the
              Admin functionality. I also setup large part of the asynchronous
              PDF preflight check system that included AWS Antivirus in S3, SQS,
              webhooks etc. I worked on the frontend a lot too with Angular,
              created a shared Cloudwatch logger package and added n-grams to
              the Elasticsearch product search, worked with lambdas and edge
              lambdas, i18n, you name it, this project had it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can not overstate how much I learned in this project. I knew
              Node, Express and Javascript going in, but everything else is
              basically what I learned throughout the 2 years. Not just
              technology but agile in a SCRUM fashion. In the end I am very
              proud of what we achieved with the product in both its usefulness
              and elegance of the design.

            <h4>Software developer trainee</h4>
            <p>
              I created a responsive WYSIWYG Teletext (Teksti-TV) editor with
              HTML5 Canvas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The point of the project was to create a clone from a 20 year old
              Java application that would run in the browser. I used this
              project to write my Bachelor's thesis that focused on creating a
              modern web app and what that entails.
            </p>
            <p>
              The learnings I had in this project have served me well over the
              years, as understanding the fundamentals of creating a web app
              from templating to building the code makes it easy for me to
              understand different frameworks quickly. I also learned a lot
              about Canvas and how use it performantly and word wrapping
              algorithms.
